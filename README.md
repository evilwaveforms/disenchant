# disenchant

Inspired by emacs plugin [disaster](https://github.com/jart/disaster), disenchant lets you see
asm of the current c/c++ file.

Assembly code is generated by first compiling the current file into an object file. The compilation
method is chosen based on the following order of precedence:

`compile_commands.json` > `Makefile` > direct gcc/g++ invocation

## installation & configuration

### lazy.nvim

Values inside `opts` are defaults. If you don't want to change them, opts can be {}.

```lua
    {
        "evilwaveforms/disenchant",
        opts = {
            keymap = {
                disassemble = "<leader>om",
            },
            compile_command_c = 'gcc -g3 -c %s -o %s.o',
            compile_command_cpp = 'g++ -g3 -c %s -o %s.o',
            objdump_command = 'objdump -Sl --demangle -Mintel --source-comment --no-show-raw-insn -d %s',
        },
    },
```
